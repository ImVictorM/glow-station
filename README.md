In this project, I was able to:

- Make requests and consume data from an API;

- Use the lifecycles of a React component;

- Using a setState function to ensure that certain code is only executed after the state is updated

- Use the BrowserRouter (Router) component correctly;

- Create routes, mapping the URL path with the corresponding component, via Route;

- Use Switch from React Router

- Create navigation links in the application with the Link component;
